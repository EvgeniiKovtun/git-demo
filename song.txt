Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on my door...
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on my door...
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on my door...
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on my door...

Baby, knock, knock, knock, kno-knock on my door
Knock, knock, knock, kno-knock


Mama, take this badge off of me…
I can't use it anymore…
It's getting dark, too dark to see…
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door…
