Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on my door...
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on my door...
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on my door...
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock on my door...

Baby, knock, knock, knock, kno-knock on my door
Knock, knock, knock, kno-knock


Mama, take this badge off of me…
I can't use it anymore…
It's getting dark, too dark to see…
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door…

Knock..knock..knocking on heaven's door…
Knock..knock..knocking on heaven's door…
Knock..knock..knocking on heaven's door…
-------------------------------------------

Mama put my guns in the ground…
I can't shoot them anymore…
That long black cloud is coming down…
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door…

Baby stay right here with me…
'Cause I can't see you anymore…
This ain't the way it's supposed to be…
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door
